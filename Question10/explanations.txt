Command: ./signal_handling
Explanation: Compiled and ran signal_handling.c. Parent process ran indefinitely, children sent SIGTERM (after 5 sec) and SIGINT (after 10 sec). Parent handled signals differently.
Observation: Terminal showed correct reception of SIGTERM and SIGINT. Verified parent exited gracefully after SIGTERM.
